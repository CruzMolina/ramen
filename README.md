# Ramen
A tool to explore caves, adventure, and find riches! ðŸ’Ž

Ramen is an quick, easy to use Javascript miner for [Provably Rare Gems](https://gems.alphafinance.io/#/rarity) on Fantom, otherwise known as raritygems.

## How to use
First, get NPM/nodejs installed. And grab all the files, of course.

Then, install a few things:
`npm i`

Make a copy of `config.default.json` called `config.json`, and fill out the details.

Then go mining:
`npm start`

## Automatic claiming
Ramen can now automatically claim gems if you edit your `config.json` to look like the example below:

THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL! I recommend you create a new account in Metamask/your Fantom wallet for this.

```json
{
    "network": {
        "chain_id": "250",
        "rpc": "https://rpc.ftm.tools/",
        "gem_address": "0x342EbF0A5ceC4404CcFF73a40f9c30288Fc72611"
    },
    "ding": true,
    "gem_type": 0,
    "address": "ADDRESS HERE",
    "claim": {
        "private_key": "PRIVATE KEY HERE",
        "maximum_gas_price": 500
    }
}
```
