# Ramen
A tool to explore caves, adventure, and find riches! ðŸ’Ž

Ramen is an experimental Javascript miner for Provably Rare Gems on Fantom, otherwise known as raritygems.

## How to use
First, get NPM/nodejs installed. And grab all the files, of course.

Then, install a few things:
`npm i`

Make a copy of `config.default.json` called `config.json`, and fill out the details.

Then go mining:
`npm start`

## Automatic claiming
Ramen can now automatically claim gems if you put the following block in your config:

THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL, use at your own risk. I recommend you create a new account in Metamask/your Fantom wallet for this.

```
"claim": {
    "private_key": "KEY HERE"
}
```
